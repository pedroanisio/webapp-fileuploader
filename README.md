## Features

- View and download uploaded files
- Clipboard text and image management
- View text content in an accordion-style interface

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Python 3.12
- Pip

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-unique-secret
```

You can generate a secret key automatically:
```sh
./generate_secret.sh
```


### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/pedroanisio/file-and-clipboard-manager.git
    cd file-and-clipboard-manager
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Build and run the Docker container:**
    ```sh
    docker build -t file-upload-app .
    docker run -p 3010:3010 file-upload-app
    ```

   If you use `docker-compose`, run `./generate_secret.sh` first so `.env` exists for the container.

### Usage

- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3010`.
- Drag and drop files into the designated area to upload.
- View, download, and manage uploaded files.
- Paste text into the clipboard section and save it. View, download, and copy clipboard text content.
